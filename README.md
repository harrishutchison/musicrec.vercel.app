# Full Stack Music Sharing App
https://musicrec.vercel.app/
Made with Vue.js, Vuexfire and Firebase Firestore.

Login with Google, navigate to a *genre* and share a song or album with others. Posts can be deleted by the user and the whole app works in real-time.

## To-do
- Fix refresh
- Genre page UI improvements
- View individual post
  - Comment
  - Upvote
- Integrate Spotify API (and others) to fetch album art to show instead of user picture
- Password protected *genres* that allow for private groups
